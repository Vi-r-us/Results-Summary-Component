# Results Summary Component

I created the Results Summary Component, featuring a modern-looking UI design that is responsive to all screen sizes. This project was developed as part of the Frontend Mentor challenge. I used JavaScript to programmatically set the result scores and Total Results. The responsive layout was achieved using a combination of grid and flexbox.
